# temnanoparticle
Repository created for the code created for our bachlor thesis. The code can set up models for nanoparticles with adsorbates and simulate TEM images. It is dependent on PyQSTEM, GPAW and ASE. The code was written by Kasper Alexander and Marcus Schmidt in the fall of 2019 for the bachelor thesis 'Simulated visualisation of adsorbed molecules on metallic nanoparticles', supervised by professor Jakob Schi√∏tz at DTU.
